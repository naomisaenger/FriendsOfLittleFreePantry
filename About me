My name is Naomi Saenger, and I am a high school junior passionate about food accessibility. A Little Free Pantry, a community-run standalone food pantry, is a powerful idea. My project hopes to alleviate food insecurity by digitizing our local network of Little Free Food pantries to help donors find out where they should donate, and showing users where they could access stocked little free pantries and food banks. An interactive map of all the resources in one place with an optional pledge of donation for donors will help foster and strengthen a greater sense of community. 
I am always looking for mentors, of any amount of assistance, to help me improve this webpage. Contact me at naomisaenger@gmail.com and I can give access to my GitHub page.
