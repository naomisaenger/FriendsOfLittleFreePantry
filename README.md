# Running the webapp:

if you'd like to use a dev server, make sure that NPM is installed,
and then in the project directory run```npm install``` to install dependencies.

rus the dev server with ```npm run serve```.

some adblockers will prevent CORS requests and prevent the Maps API from being loaded.
